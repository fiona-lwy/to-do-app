# To-Do App

The to-do app is created for users to add to-do tasks in a list.
The input field automatically empties itself after the user adds a to-do task.

There are three options users can do:

1. When the task is done, click on the checkbox to tick it.
2. When you want to delete the task, click on the DELETE button.
3. If you want to change the to-do task, you can delete it and add the item again.
